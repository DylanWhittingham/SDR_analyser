First of all, signal strength is measured in dBm, not dB: dBm is the value, dB is the difference.

For example, if +20 dBm is being transmitted and -40 dBm is being received, then there is a loss of 60 dB, or it could be stated that the signal has a difference of -60 dB from the transmitter to the receiver.

0 dBm is the reference used to measure power and is equal to 1 milliwatt (mW), or 0.001 W.

So, any measurement less than 1mW converts to a negative dBm value:

-50 dBm = 0.00001 mW (or 10 uW)

-40 dBm = 0.0001 mW (or 100 uW)

-30 dBm = 0.001 mW

-20 dBm = 0.01 mW

-10 dBm = 0.1 mW

0 dBm = 1.0 mW

+10 dBm = 10 mW

+20 dBm = 100 mW

+30 dBm = 1000 mW (or 1 Watt).
